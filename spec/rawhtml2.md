## Disallowed Raw HTML (extension)

GFM enables the `tagfilter` extension, where the following HTML tags will be
filtered when rendering HTML output:

* `<title>`
* `<textarea>`
* `<style>`
* `<xmp>`
* `<iframe>`
* `<noembed>`
* `<noframes>`
* `<script>`
* `<plaintext>`

Filtering is done by replacing the leading `<` with the entity `&lt;`.  These
tags are chosen in particular as they change how HTML is interpreted in a way
unique to them (i.e. nested HTML is interpreted differently), and this is
usually undesireable in the context of other rendered Markdown content.

All other HTML tags are left untouched.
